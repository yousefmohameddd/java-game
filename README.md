# Last of Us Grid Game

## Description
This game was developed using Java and JavaFX, following OOP principles. In this game, you navigate through a 15x15 grid map filled with dangers. The objective is to find vaccines to cure zombies and rebuild the community. The player can be either an explorer, medic, or fighter, each with their own unique abilities.Â 

## Gameplay Overview
You select your hero and start at the top left corner, only being able to see your adjacent cells. \
You use action points to go through the map, searching for supplies and vaccines, and run away from any zombies; otherwise, you risk being attacked!\
You can use the vaccine to cure a zombie or use a supply to activate a special ability, depending on your character:
- Fighter: Attack multiple times in a single turn without using action points
- Medic: Heal other heroes or themselves
- Explorer: Show the entire map for a single turn

Be quick, though, as the horde grows with each passing turn!
Once you cure five zombies or the heroes are overwhelmed, the game ends.
